Module "pin_mux"   (component PinSettings)
   - pin_mux_hardware_init -This method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method in user code to route 
                desired pins into peripherals. The method is useful for reinitialization HW after some routing changes.
   - pin_mux_configure_ftm_pins -FTM method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into FTM0, FTM1, FTM2, FTM3 peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_gpio_pins -GPIO method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into PTA, PTB, PTC, PTD, PTE peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_i2c_pins -I2C method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into I2C0, I2C1 peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_i2s_pins -I2S method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into I2S0 peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_jtag_pins -JTAG method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into JTAG peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_llwu_pins -LLWU method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into LLWU peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_osc_pins -OSC method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into OSC peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_rtc_pins -RTC method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into RTC peripheral.
   - pin_mux_configure_spi_pins -SPI method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into SPI0, SPI1 peripherals.
   - pin_mux_configure_uart_pins -UART method sets registers according routing settings. Call this method code to route desired 
                pins into UART0, UART1, UART2 peripherals.

Module "Term1"     (component Term)
   - Term1_CRLF -Send CRLF to terminal.
   - Term1_SendStr -Send string to terminal.
   - Term1_SendNum -Send number to terminal.
   - Term1_SendChar -Send char to terminal.
   - Term1_Cls -Clear the terminal window.
   - Term1_MoveTo -Move cursor to position x, y. Range of coordinates can be from 1 to the size, which depends on the used 
                terminal. Position [1,1] represents the upper left corner.
   - Term1_ReadChar -Read char from terminal.
   - Term1_KeyPressed -Test if char was received from the terminal.

Module "Cpu"       (component MK22FN512LH12)
   - Cpu_SetClockConfiguration -Calling of this method will cause the clock configuration change and reconfiguration of all 
                components according to the requested clock configuration setting.
   - Cpu_GetClockConfiguration -Returns the active clock configuration identifier. The method is automatically enabled if more 
                than one clock configuration is enabled in the component.
